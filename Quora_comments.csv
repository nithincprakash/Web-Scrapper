Problems of social media,"A2A.Yes it is.I was made aware that I myself have it by a well-wisher. The most popular social media sites today are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. The common trend I have observed in these sites is that they thrive on the need of people seeking validation from others. I am not at all saying that I am not afflicted with this addiction. There was a time when I used to post daily selfies on my facebook page. All the likes, comments felt really good and did help with the self esteem issue a bit.What I didn’t realize was that this false and short lived self-esteem boost was preventing me from actually working on the issue. Like my low self esteem was a result of me not having achieved anything in life. And posting a selfie wouldn’t be as helpful as sending out a resume and actively job hunting.I think social media addiction, like any other addiction, just gives you a temporary high. It will never help you to really address your issue. Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying social media is bad. It has been very useful when used right.","Answered Jan 4, 2018","{'sadness': 0.253621, 'joy': 0.518786, 'fear': 0.10173, 'disgust': 0.143155, 'anger': 0.109585}",Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/Is-Social-Media-addiction-a-real-problem,Is Social Media addiction a real problem?
Problems of social media,"In 2016, as you can see from the image, the average time spent on social media in US each day is about 2 hours, this means there are people who pass a lot more time there and It’s not only about the 2 physical hours but it’s also about the mental time that you are wasting: if you were focused and distract yourself to check the new notification that has popped out on Instagram then, as you maybe have experienced, will be difficult to return in that state of complete focus (also called “flow mode”, where doesn’t exist nothing except what you are working on, which is the real time when you are really learning).You maybe have also experienced the need to check what’s new on your phone after a long afternoon or night without internet connection.. Well, if it’s your case, you are addicted.But don’t worry too much because It’s normal nowadays, you are just one of many people who wear out their life to be conscious as soon as possible of where came from the big likes or the big attentions or the big activities that could be happened in the last few hours with no internet on your phone.When someone put a like on your photo or on your status you feel a good sensation, right? When there are lots of people who put like on your new photo you maybe feel like “Aww yess, I’m so cool”, right?This happens because you have a dopamine release after having seen the appreciation of the other people which let you think that you are important and people accept and approve you. This process is built by the social media companies based on our human and biological condition and desire: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat etc. are studied to make you addicted.Don’t believe me? Watch what the ex-CEO of facebook has said about it.I’m going to write a little summary of what happened to me:I’m a calisthenics (gymnastic sport based) athlete and when my body started to build some muscle I immediately posted pics of my body on Instagram…Yes I was very very proud when girls put like on my pics and after few days I felt the need to feel another time that good ego-boost sensation of appreciation. What happened was that I posted another pic of my body, even though was basically the same photo that I posted few days back, and so on during the time trying to invent some excuse (“I want to show you that I’m able to do this exercise”.. Bulls**t) to post some pic of me to feel again that sensation.I falled in the trap, I was addicted.There are drastic and soft precautions to take to avoid turning off the brain watching passively a screen without thinking or feeling nothing and to avoid the addiction of being appreciated in a false virtual world.I personally started removing Snapchat and Facebook first and after a year Instagram.I now use only Facebook only from browser to skip the register phase to websites (“Log in with Facebook”) and to contact girls which I forgot to ask their number.I noticed that now I pass more time with my brain turned on, I’m generally more awake, I read more (2 to 3 books per month) and I have businesses like this blog.If you want to continue to use social media, you could limit yourself putting things not easily arm-reachable: for example you can use Facebook via browser or you can have Instagram installed only to post pics or to send/watch new messages.One another important thing: stay away from garbage on social media.Avoid mediocre useless drama that affects your mental health and surround yourself by positive spreading-energy things!Source: The Social Media Problems","Answered Jun 8, 2018","{'sadness': 0.575876, 'joy': 0.625551, 'fear': 0.139064, 'disgust': 0.044145, 'anger': 0.098707}",Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/Is-Social-Media-addiction-a-real-problem,Is Social Media addiction a real problem?
Problems of social media,"Is Social Media Dependence a Mental Health Issue? | The FixDefinitely. Financially, social media addictions are costing businesses and individuals billions of dollars (in the form of employees checking social media sites instead of working and individuals flitting away countless hours that could be better invested in endeavors with more tangible payoffs). And then there are the social costs associated with neglecting important obligations to family, friends, and loved ones. It's only a question of the time until the definition of addictions is extended to reveal that the most common and destructive addicts are hopelessly addicted to safety, power, acceptance, approval, attention, esteem, status, and money (that trigger the same dopamine junkies trigger with heroin, smokers trigger with nicotine, food addicts trigger with junk foods, and social media addicts trigger with likes, upvotes, followers, and selfies). All manmade problems can be traced to the money, power, and status addicts who control the institutions that define addictions. There is only one addiction and it's to the neurotransmitter dopamine. Which is why all addicts share the same symptoms — self-deceptions, denial, an inability to admit to addictions, an intransigent commitment to continue indulging in their favorite dopamine triggering behaviors, and an indifference to the damage caused by their need to feed insatiable addictions.","Answered May 4, 2014","{'sadness': 0.637531, 'joy': 0.632259, 'fear': 0.184843, 'disgust': 0.060956, 'anger': 0.066065}",Very Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/Is-Social-Media-addiction-a-real-problem,Is Social Media addiction a real problem?

Constantly tweeting - if you're not a celebrity or in the media business or you do not need it tweet as part of your job description - might make others think you have a huge ego and that you just want to let the whole world know what you're doing when not very many people truly care.

Problems of social media,"I think we can all agree that there are many issues with social media even though there are many good things about it too. Today I'm sharing 5 problems with social media:1) Cyber bullying- This is the worst thing about social media in my opinion. The bullies don't realise how they are depressing so many people by bullying them online. It makes teens want to kill themselves and it is so so so wrong. The internet should be one big happy place to bring people closer together and even though it does do that, there's still many cases of people bullying on it.2) Too much social media- Sure everyone loves instagram, facebook, snapchat, twitter... but imagine if you spend 1 hour a day per social media app, it will add up to at least 6/7 hours of your day wasted!3) Messaging apps- I think everyone knows what I'm about to talk about. Perverts and paedophfiles! kids from the ages of 7-12 use these types of apps and when they get messages from kids who they think are the same age, they turn out to be over 30 sometimes and they ask for nudes and try to meet up with kids to rape and sometimes kill them. Most of the time kids think that there's nothing wrong with meeting up with a ""12"" year old, but they don't know that that's not their real age.4) We aren't spending quality time together- We are locked in our rooms tweeting and instagraming our friends 24/7 and when you do finally get to meet up with them for sleepovers you spend all your time on your phones and taking selfies.5) We forget to live the moment- You got to a concert and most of the time you are there you are taking videos and pictures instead of living in the moment!

Problems of social media,"Is social media addictive? The issue is complex, and probably generational.It’s obvious that what social media does to us, especially those of us who are heavy users, is not natural, or normal. It’s not normal to submit opinions for approval every day to an online crowd, nor is it normal to consume the opinions of strangers in bulk. It’s not normal to live under the surveillance of software companies, which tailor their advertising with such eerie precision that it seems impossible that they are not listening in on our conversations. It’s definitely not normal to wake in the night to use social media, or to spend roughly 24 hours a week on it, returning again and again even though it can make us feel depressed and alone. None of these behaviours were normal a few decades ago, nor are they especially useful to us today, but they’re practised by billions of people across the world.On Monday a report was published by an all-party parliamentary group (APPG), proposing that internet addiction could be classified as a disease, and that research into its impact on mental health could be funded by a taxing social media companies. The paper includes surveys showing that 27% of children who spend three or more hours a day online show symptoms of mental ill health, and called for “robust, longitudinal research” into the possibility of social media addiction.Addiction is characterised by abnormal behaviour, but what is “normal” any more? Could anyone stand to live without a smartphone, in 2019, and to go without social media? There will be readers who argue it’s easy, but for a vast number trying to stay afloat in a precarious, internet-ravaged job market, the answer is no.The stereotype of the basement-dwelling internet addict is not new – it’s more than two decades since Japanese psychologist Tamaki Saitō coined the term hikikomori to describe a generation of recluses in Japan, who traded their social lives for internet, video-game and media consumption and a state of “adolescence without end”. In 1995, The Unabomber manifesto asked that we “never forget that a human being with technology is exactly like an alcoholic with a barrel of wine”. Its author, Ted Kaczynski, is, of course, a murderer and a terrorist, and steeped in his own rigidly biased view of civilisation, but the line is prescient: we are the alcoholics, and the barrel is a collection of scrolling feeds we gorge on, drowning before we’ve had our fill. Add social media, and the result is a toxic brew of solipsism and information overload, the kind that one is either overwhelmed by, or turns one into a monster in order to survive. The UX design employed by these platforms is a maze of dark patterns and cues borrowed from the world of gambling. To use these sites is to become “addicted” – it’s in their interest that you never sign out, and keep generating data indefinitely.Three years ago I was advised by psychiatrists to avoid social media. 2016 was, by anyone’s standards, a fairly difficult year to be on the internet, but the experience had left me neurotic and self-loathing, experiencing multiple panic attacks every day. I spent more time online than with other people, and social media had narrowed my view of the world, encouraging me to think in binary terms of good and bad, like and dislike, the kind of black-and-white thinking common to personality disorders and depression.The link between social media and this narrowing of perspective is well documented: back in 2011, the term “filter bubble” was popularised by Eli Pariser in his book of the same name. It describes the algorithmic hypnosis that companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter perform on their users, learning their habits and reinforcing them with tailored content. Social media, which once promised to act as a window to the world, has slowly but surely become an engine for a kind of global solipsism, a breeding ground for “fake news”, bias, compulsion and vanity – which profit the shareholders of these platforms.Source - The guardianI hope this has given you clarity.

Problems of social media,"As someone who uses social media on a daily basis, I would argue that social media does not inherently damage mental health. The mere act of scanning through or posting on Instagram, for example, does not in itself cause any issues. Moreover, there are many positive mental health pages on social media, which promote recovery and happiness.However, used incorrectly or excessively, social media certainly has potential to be dangerous. Perhaps the most frequently used example is the “promotion” of anorexia by way of skinny, photoshopped models and bikini pictures. It is important to note that eating disorders are mental health disorders which are rooted in far more complex causes than a simple desire to look thin. However, for some, this could be the tipping point that spurs them into unhealthy coping mechanisms or could feel an already growing obsession with weight and shape.Social media can provide a platform for people struggling to vent, allowing them to express their pain, which can help, at least in the short term. However, this can also trigger others into a downward spiral as they pick up on the negative thinking and potential behaviours.Most damaging of all, though, is the hyper-focus on likes, comments, followers etc. Social media activity has, for many, become synonymous with popularity and a measure of self worth. Consequently, users spend their time in anguish, glued to a screen awaiting external validation. There is a need to create “perfect” content, so rather than living in the moment and documenting memories when they feel like it, victims of the obsession feel obliged to partake in things for a post on social media. A constant need to look flawless can certainly take its toll on one’s mental health, taking the focus away from enjoyment by placing it all on a single, superficial trait.To conclude, social media has a great potential to severely impact mental health. The obsessive culture surrounding it can become a cause for anxiety, eating disorders and self harm, in addition to some of the content shared regarding these matters. However, used sensibly, I maintain that social media can enhance good mental health by encouraging connectivity, spreading positivity, and providing important information, including information about mental health itself. The impact of social media on mental health is therefore determined by the individual user - by their thoughts and beliefs regarding it, the amount of time spent on it, and the content they choose to view.","Answered Jan 8, 2019","{'sadness': 0.637898, 'joy': 0.548435, 'fear': 0.538625, 'disgust': 0.069788, 'anger': 0.077381}",Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/How-does-social-media-affect-mental-health-1,How does social media affect mental health?

Problems of social media,"Social media is readily available nowadays and used by people of all ages. Adolescents and young adults create a large population of these online platforms. Adolescents use social media as a source of entertainment and communication among their peers. The availability of cell phones, laptops and digital devices create access to social media no matter where you are. It also allows individuals to connect with other users from other countries in the world. There are many benefits to social media such as enhanced communication and access to many resources, however there are many risks too. The rise in mental health issues has never been so prominent and can be correlated with the increased usage of social media.Cyberbullying “is the most common online risk for all teens and is a peer-to-peer risk (O’Keeffe).” As mass communication is so readily available, cyberbullying is easy to act upon. As the conversation largely happens with text and images, harsh language is used without a second thought. This can lead to depression, anxiety and possible suicide. Researchers are discussing a phenomenon called ‘Facebook Depression’ (Barry) where pre-teens and teens spend the majority of their spare time on the platform Facebook and cause feelings of depression. Teenagers and young adults frequently experience ‘FOMO,’ (Barry) a term describing ‘fear of missing out, which causes internalized feelings of exclusion and anxiety. As current events and locations are readily publicized, it is simple to see what your acquaintances are doing, who they are with and their location. The teenage years are sensitive and rely heavily on acceptance. The concept of constantly chasing after more ‘likes’ and ‘followers’ demonstrate how social media users strive after popularity in online communities. The massive database and global communication directs teenagers to constantly compare themselves to others. This can create insecurities and low self-esteem.As social media and the power of the Internet allows access to unlimited resources, individuals with mental health issues can turn to online websites to research about their offline and online problems. There are studies that show the benefits of social media to those with serious mental health issues. Using social media, “individuals with serious mental illness could challenge stigma through personal empowerment and providing hope” (Naslund). As there are many interactions between users, this creates social bonding and a sense of belonging and acceptance. However, those “who suffer from Facebook depression are at risk for social isolation and sometimes turn to risky Internet sites and blogs for “help” that may promote substance abuse, unsafe sexual practices, or aggressive or self-destructive behaviors (O’Keeffe).” These online communities do not have professional expert advice that are evidence-based and can lead to false positives and self-diagnosis. Users can freely post derogatory and judgemental comments which may worsen individual’s current situation. Overall, social media affects adolescents stage of development and has detrimental effects on their mental health.Barry, C. T., Sidoti, C. L., Briggs, S. M., Reiter, S. R., & Lindsey, R. A. (2017).

Problems of social media,"The myth of Free Wi-Fi and Social NetworkBy Venugopal Acharya(Vraja Bihari Das)Human society has made incredible strides in science and technology yet in spite of what appears an unstoppable success march, a small poisonous arrow of a time-wasting obsession could be our weakness, our downfall.However talented or smart you think you are you’d have at least one weakness- the Achilees heel. And the negative forces inside your subtle mental world are aware of your frailties as well as your strengths. These deficiencies snowball with our cocky dismissal of wise sayings or when we carelessly refuse to tap our gifts.

Since there is no proper engagement for your mind, the internet- like drugs or liquor for Lokesh- would quickly drag you down.I once read a news item of a sixteen-year-old boy who was hooked to pornography- freely available on the internet- and one day in a fit of madness, sexually assaulted his sister. Instead of using the internet, the wily web had him in its vicious grip. The young boy wasted both his precious time and his God-given conscience.Let’s spread goodness around- we need fragrant, succulent fruit-yielding trees in our society.

Problems of social media,"Undoubtedly so.  I wouldn't say it is the actual cause for the majority - most often the root cause lies much deeper either through genetic predisposition or through environmental influence - but it certainly has the potential to magnify any issues/negative feeling that existed before.  I believe the only people who really benefit from these sites are people who use them solely for financial gain - i.e to promote a business or advertise a product.

Such sites often have 'moderators' who keep everything in line - both in terms of site organisation and content  -  I suppose one is just a more traditional, genre specific and selective form of online interaction in a more controlled environment, which in my opinion is much better - especially where users can be young or particularly vulnerable.","Answered Apr 2, 2015","{'sadness': 0.664639, 'joy': 0.273055, 'fear': 0.050824, 'disgust': 0.05405, 'anger': 0.058892}",Satisfied,https://www.quora.com/Besides-other-factors-is-social-media-a-cause-of-anxiety-depression-and-modern-day-psychological-health-problems,"Besides other factors, is social media a cause of anxiety, depression, and modern day psychological health problems?"

Problems of social media,"Social media itself isn’t causing a mental health crisis, its just a tool for communication, but it is revealing in all of us an often neglected need to connect. Ironically in seeking that connection through social media it often has the opposite effect, removing us from those who really love us with a false substitute that only leaves us wanting more.We naively think we are in control but are vastly outwitted by social media’s billion dollar algorithms engineered to maximize traffic. Suicide rates and mental illness rates are definitely rising with the rise social media so there’s no question people are ill affected.

Problems of social media,"Social media is indeed a significant tool for empowerment of people. As social media enlarges its reach even to the lower class, the popular perception is now based on social media trends. Social media has the power to scrutinize the government, uncover the truth, along with the power to create false truths (fake news). Social media trends increasingly govern our electoral politics. Thus nowadays, governments cannot ignore the buzz in the social media world. In this background, movements like #MeToo does create pressure on governments to do something about sexual harassment faced by women. And often “actual concrete” actions are taken in response to such movements.However, I am not very optimistic about the social movements that are “entirely” based on social media. Just like all other tools, it has to be used in the right way - to increase reach, create awareness about issues, organise protests etc. A movement that is entirely based on social media is haunted by its own strength - dynamism.Social media is very dynamic. The popular trends can change within days, even within hours. Further, with digital armies of various interest groups, hijacking a movement on social media is very easy. Add to this the poor “memory” of social media, which can forget #MeToo for a celebrity gossip. Therefore, for a social movement to be effective it needs to have a strong “offline presence”, otherwise everything is an illusion in the virtual world. Of course, social media is a great multiplier, but don’t use it on zero.Let me now address the “problem of dynamism” from an individual perspective. There is a great saying - “no pain no gain”. In other words, without investments, there is no bounty. On social media when people share a “revolutionary post”, there is very little investment (physical or emotional) on their part. Such low-risk activity is of the nature of “nothing to lose and everything to gain”. In such a scenario, when the desired result is not achieved, people don’t feel angry as there was very little investment to lose. So they forget about it and move to other social media trends. Compare this with offline protest, where people compromise on their daily wages, shout slogans in scorching heat, face lathi-charge and water cannons. Here-in lies the investment - physical and emotional - and a strong belief towards the cause which is reflected in the “pain” they are ready to take. This “junta”, unlike social media activists, will not simply move away if desired results are not achieved. They will fight again (as they have invested a lot). This type of protests generally yields better results (for e.g. Nirbhaya Andolan).Again, things are not black and white to this extent. A lot depends on how responsive the government is. A very responsive government will bring reforms even on social media trends let alone social media movements. But such governments are still a distant dream in all democracies.","Answered Nov 9, 2018","{'sadness': 0.571388, 'joy': 0.669079, 'fear': 0.114931, 'disgust': 0.157983, 'anger': 0.127186}",Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/Is-posting-problems-on-social-media-with-movements-like-MeToo-really-helpful,"Is posting problems on social media, with movements like #MeToo, really helpful?"
Problems of social media,"Thanks for the A2A Nitin AgrawalI had written a couple of answers on the topic when the #MeToo phenomenon was really hot:Baseema Husseini's answer to Has the #MeToo movement gone too far?Baseema Husseini's answer to How will #MeToo campaign bring the change in our society?Now the problem with #MeToo as I had mentioned in one of my previous answers is, it reduces the shock value of an accusation of molestation. Previously, when someone would be accused of sexual harassment, it would result in wide-eyed stares, the person would be ostracized, and people, men included, would assume the woman to be an innocent victim and the man to be guilty. Back in the era not too far back, it did make sense from a collective sense to hold such assumptions. Because everyone would assume that most men were well-behaved (and that is actually the case) and so would be most women. And hence a woman who claims her modesty was outraged would be doing so despite the shame that such victimhood would carry, because she could no longer put up with the trauma. Which meant that the matter was definitely very serious, and necessitated either mob action (not a fan of it, but you should kiss goodbye to logic when understanding mob behaviour), or HR action from the company (suspension, firing, initiating inquiry, etc etc.) or police action.Now during the #MeToo movement, a lot of women jumped on the bandwagon, to report matters such as being touched inappropriately in a bus, or being pursued romantically / sexually despite a previous rejection. And some women have also doneHarassment during travel, a person pursuing another are not something that the police can deal with as crimes. It is nearly impossible to prove them, and as such, need to be dealt with on a personal level (unless a guy is threatening a girl to concede to his demands, in which case it becomes an act of assault under the law of torts.). When such allegations happen as part of #MeToo mentions, people have begun to take such allegations with less seriousness. No longer do they feel a sense of shock, and while the initial few allegations on Nana Patekar and MJ Akbar shocked the country, the ongoing fallout of the movement no longer finds place in everyday discussions like it used to a couple of months back.However, it is the false accusations (which many have come to suspect for a lot many cases). Due to such allegations, not only will people begin to take #MeToo admissions less seriously, they will begin to doubt their veracity itself. It is not for nothing that #BelieveWomen was also trending, because the #MeToo movement has/had begun to do more damage to the cause of genuinely affected women than benefit them.It is easy to see how things will pan out in future if social media movements, especially the #MeToo movement continue to proliferate:i) Companies will have to stop the practice of automatically firing employees who are accused, because soon there will be an outcry to not treat accused employees as guilty and begin their punishment already by causing a loss of employment and rendering them as outcasts for other employersii) Because companies will begin to wait till accusations are proven true to fire employees, often times the accused and the accuser will have to work in the same office, leading to uncomfortable situations, whether or not the accusation was genuine, over-stated, or false.iii) If a lot of cases fail to result in conviction of the accused, there will be a demand to protect the identity of the accused as well, in order to prevent the loss of social standing from a sexual harassment accusationiv) Because their identities are protected, the accused will not face any immediate consequences, and will go on with their routine lives while letting their lawyers deal with the court proceedings.v) The conviction rate of sexual harassment cases in India is very low because it is very difficult to establish a case which can establish guilt on an accuser beyond reasonable doubt (unless there is physical evidence). Also, court proceedings take a lot many years,vi) The accused is almost always going to be in a position of much superior power, by position and financially. Hence he will be able to influence a lot many people whose opinions would matter in the court case (as against the online commentators whose opinions only add up to noise), and will also be able to afford more expensive lawyers.I am not saying that posting problems on social media would not help in raising awareness, but such social media posts should not be accusatory by nature. Leveling accusations in social media as opposed to following the due process of law will almost always result in causing more harm than good.","Answered Jan 1, 2019","{'sadness': 0.624695, 'joy': 0.106904, 'fear': 0.177293, 'disgust': 0.525325, 'anger': 0.254128}",Very Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/Is-posting-problems-on-social-media-with-movements-like-MeToo-really-helpful,"Is posting problems on social media, with movements like #MeToo, really helpful?"
Problems of social media,"The question is not exactly clear….. “Is it helpful?” to do what? Is it helpful to create awareness? Does it serve justice? Is it helpful to encourage women to speak up about atrocities? And many more….Is it helpful to create awareness? Definitely not…. I mean, we should be ashamed of ourselves for we need a movement like this to help us realize how rampant the issue of sexual harassment, atrocities is…. We really should be ashamed. Think for a moment….What happened with Nirbhaya wasn't frightening enough to create awareness?What happened in Unnao and kathua didn't create awareness?The rape case from kopardi, Maharashtra that stirred the whole state, wasn't enough to make us realize how critical this issue is?Have we really gone so numb to such incidents happening around us that we need a mere platform like social media to make us realize about those incidents? We should really think about this…The women (or men, if any) who have used the social media sites, to give a way to their resentments and repugnance about what happened with them, had access to those sites. What about those who don't have such access? What about an illiterate human being from some rural area? If inveighing on social media is what it takes to ask for justice, then those from rural areas should completely give up the hope for justice.What happens next to a complaint on social media? Someone blames somebody. We all go bonkers about that person and his character. We all reach to a intellectual conclusion that he/she has a risqué comportment. But does it change anything? Does our conclusions, verdicts change anything? Does that punish the culprit? No…. It doesn't. It just exacerbates the whole issue. Adds fuel to the fire…. The only right thing that can be or rather should be done is by the judiciary system. No matter how weak it has become and how many loopholes it has, our verdicts won't avert someone's malicious intentions. What'll prevent it, is a punitive measure by judiciary.No matter how vehemently we speak about these things, no matter how harshly we castigate the accused, if he/she is not punished legally, he/she can preposterously claim a vindication. We can just speak about the whole issue. That's it…. We don't have the resources or abilities to investigate such incidents, to check for truth.I remember this dialogue from some bollywood movie. “100 gunhegar choot gaye toh bhi theek hai par ek begunah ko saza nahi honi chahiye…” (Its fine if 100 culprits are left unpunished but not a single innocent person should be punished.) I recall this dialogue because it brings me to think about the side of this issue which isn't really welcomed. What if even one of the accused turns out to be innocent? Just to support women, the women power, we are going to turn a blind eye towards an innocent? Why that person should face all that insult, all that humiliation? Above all, why should his family face the same? We don't do that even to a person who's been legally convicted….. I won't speak much about this part. Its better left to your wise judgement…So to sum up…. Use of social media for #MeToo movement does nothing else than encouraging the victims. Those who faced such incidents, should speak up. And just the way they speak about it on social media, they should or rather must approach the judiciary system as well…. I believe it isn't completely insensitive about these issues….

Problems of social media,"Social Media is not the solution to the problems one faces.To be brutally honest, Social Media is a toothless tiger in such sensitive matters. While the Twitterati or Facebookers or Redditians may support a girl in their comments, likes and shares.The same people ignore a helpless naked girl lying on the road after being raped Does that ring a bell??? Oh yes! Talking about the Nirbhaya Case of 2012.The same people do not care to raise their voice or even protest against anyone objectifying a woman publically.All this rant on Social Media is for what? Show off? So that one can share the screenshots to prove that one is an aware and enlightened citizen?Some issues that engulf the MeToo movement in the Social Media domain are as follows:Lack of Outreach and Celebrity CentricA major chunk of population has been left due to the digital aspect of the movement. The rural female population who face subjugation and events like marital rape, domestic violence, mental and physical harassment are untouched by the movement and hence a large number of cases have not even come to light. The movement is very celebrity centric where only a well known name is overpublicised and overemphasized by the Media and the Social Media all alike for garnering public attention and the real purpose is never actually fulfilled.Lack of Legal implicationsOut of the the plethora of men named in the secual harassment cases only a few have been dragged to the court by the accused. In most just an alleged accusation is made which may or may not be true. Thus ambiguity and hesitant females who do not move to court have put up a big question mark against the movement.The MeToo ParadoxOne very largely talked about issue pertaining to the movement is naming of the males after a long time after the incidents have happened. Now this is a very tricky situation. The male ill definitely deny the accusation and lack of evidences and witnesses will let thean walk free even if he had actually done something. No matter how much you name a person in public or rant about it. The damage is only to the image of a person (exceptions excluded) which surely and slowly improves. But the female is stuck at the same place she was. Furthermore she now becomes vulnerable to the animosity that has been born and you never know how that may turn out to be. Instead of letting women free MeToo in a way is caging them further in fear and anxiety. Further, if the empowered women in the more sophisticated fields are afraid to speak up and do so after years, how can you expect the lower strata of women to be fearless enough to speak up against the wrongs being done to them.No Objective, People PoliticsThe MeToo Objective is very opaque and vague in nature. What it tries and wants to achieve is very difficult to determine. Furthermore, Media is using it as a tool to fill its TRP Coffers. People such as Rakhi Sawant etc. are using the platform to promote themselves in the name of defending the accused. People are playing politics over the issue and this is one of the major causes why the movement will die down.The Movement has largely encouraged and made women fearless in speaking up against the atrocities of the largely patriarchal setup that they work and live in. However, only words will not improve the society. While some have gotten away with apology, some have filed defamation cases. On top of all this the cases of false accusations have been on rampant rise due to which anyone now suspects the motives of a woman once she males an accusation. She is not believed and this is taken advantage of by the men who harass them.Social Media rants are no good and women have to learn to take the bull by its horns. I know its easier said than done but one has to learn, though slowly, women have to learn that the right channels to get justice is not Social Media but the Court of Law and Order. Reforms in the laws now ensure expedited enquiry and fast track courts with all legal help which will make their path to justice a lot easier than before.Hope this helps!!!","Answered Nov 10, 2018","{'sadness': 0.513887, 'joy': 0.533472, 'fear': 0.132932, 'disgust': 0.520548, 'anger': 0.487921}",Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/Is-posting-problems-on-social-media-with-movements-like-MeToo-really-helpful,"Is posting problems on social media, with movements like #MeToo, really helpful?"

Red light areas, girl shelter homes, orphanage centres, domestic violence etc. ???Social media is in real sense is technological revolution to spread the information at faster pace whether anonymously or directly. And hence it provide a better platform to everyone to express his/her sweet/bitter experiences of life and in this way revealing the reality of the society we live in.#metoo is unprecedented revolution in the line of women empowerment and their place in the society. The subjugation, exploitation, negligence, harassment, violence they face at workplace, home, roads by the predators is not new thing to be known to all. But #metoo movement sensitise this issue as a evil and hence to make it clear that this is not the privilege of men to undermine the dignity of women.The stories of the movement certainly put a moral obligations over all of us to rethink the way we have and are treating the women as a commodity or a thing of pleasure. Coveted post holders being named as harasser opened our eyes to see the things what actually they are. Intimation of women for our lusty self satisfaction would not be tolerable anymore.However the depressed who don't have a voice to raise it is again the duty and responsibility of the print and tele media to unearth such assault over the dignity of underprivileged and hence to help them to be part of mainstreme society with more power.Hope is less but never be hopeless.","Answered Nov 21, 2018","{'sadness': 0.640815, 'joy': 0.548579, 'fear': 0.111307, 'disgust': 0.214547, 'anger': 0.145396}",Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/Is-posting-problems-on-social-media-with-movements-like-MeToo-really-helpful,"Is posting problems on social media, with movements like #MeToo, really helpful?"

Problems of social media,"Whether we like it or not, Social Media has grown to be a huge monster that no one can ignore.Every person having a face in Facebook is now a potential News Correspondent or a potential VIP (a Virtually Important Person) who can post anything good, bad, sensible, nonsense, sensual and sensational and get away with it.The whole social Media, from one perspective has turned to be a welcome antidote to the highly biased and shameless TV / News Media who are rightly called Presstitudes and help in building positive public opinion about the falsehood floated in the organized media.On the other side, social media comprises of a vastly emotional, highly sentimental and strongly opinianated and judgmental common people, who are ready to believe anything posted in Social Media as genuine and consider even fake news and falsehood as highly socially important stuff to throw their weight on.The #metoo movement in Social Media has indeed succeeded in creating a huge awareness about a social malady and has encouraged so many women to come forward and share their experiences without a sense of unwanted shame. At the same time, it seems to have helped to shame some public figures openly without scope of verification -- social media declaring judgement on some individuals without a legal case and investigation.As Mr Kishor Mali has said in his answer here, social media is indeed a double edged sword. It can harm others as well as oneself. Almost a month back I saw a long video live-posted by a popular woman in Facebook justifying her accusation of sexual harassment reportedly committed by a popular Cinema personality years ago. The latter obviously has a huge fan fallowing. I was really shocked to see the type of negative, harsh and third rate criticism (with liberal doze of cuss words) the woman was receiving from the fans of the accused.#metoo movement, I suspect, has also given scope to some wily women to settle scores with their ex suiters whose relationship soured later.But one thing is common between social media and regular media -- anything sensational is a rage. Once one rage loses sheen, the next one takes over.

People coming together and boycotting a predator or the guilty person.What i have taken from the movement is that as you yourself has felt about it that the movement also shows what a perception can do and how that movement helps in breaking a certain perception in a society.

Problems of social media,"SOciety at all times had three types of people: The Confident, no-nonsense lot, the timid and wining lot and the brash and over- confident lot. The timid let others ride rough over them and keep quiet, but join the chorus when some boldone challenges a brash one. ME TOO and such movements arise becausee of such unwarranted trespasses fisrt allowed for fear of losing a job, a chance etc, (or even willingly gone through ) and now that someone has come out in the open to denigrate and shame an established person with a shady past, these “victims “ join the chorus. The Entertainment , Media , Fine Arts ,Performing Arts, Sports , etc are fields where people with fluid personality are disproportionately more. than in other fields.. They may include Transgenders (some of whom previously had to hide their gender status) who might have not thought it unusual for them to mix freely with women at work places and might even have built a great rapport with them , because of their sensitivity to women’s problems. Friendship with such border margin males make women bolder to deal with full fledged he-males, but they may be braash and aggressive in seeking what they want. When clothed with power and authority, the Fluid ones behave partial to women, and he-males tend to exploit the vulnerable women, even as thewy let go of assertive women; and in some cases act revengeful for resisting their advances. ME TOO serves more to let out pent up anger whenit begins to hurt conscience.Not found discussed in the noise about Me Too is the small group of people who started their career ,offering to be comfort companions to people in power or authority or influence, (of both genders) but were discreet enough not to brag about it, and continue to be in lime light, but on their own steam. If they too join the discussions and tell it all, the story would perhaps be complete.

Problems of social media,"I have more than one and they are all linked to each other. The biggest would be answering “What am I up against?”. So that led me to MY 7 challenges which I have to overcome. The information available online is so overwhelming that I felt like I was in a little boat afloat in the middle of the ocean.I had to make sense of the information, data and everything digital happening around me and my brand. I had to Perceive the Pattern that best suited my brand.There I was, at the end of the year 2017. Fresh with knowledge on how to do digital marketing from an online digital marketing course from UpGrad. The experience of tried and tested campaigns, with an equal mix of success and failure. Yet there was something lacking.That elusive, singular goal that I was still chasing.I had defined it several times in the past with objectives and plans of action and yet fell short somehow. I was refusing to accept the shortcoming, be it co-operation or budgets, and kept pushing on to no avail.Then it dawned on me. If we keep doing things the way we always have, we will get what we already have. It was time for a change.And the best place to start was my approach and outlook. My first change was to note down the problems and challenges and accept them.So I started with social media, Facebook to be exact and I had to deal with the following challenges:Lack of sufficient resourcesBudgets, time and talent. This challenge is only compounded when all three are insufficient. And make no mistake, having an excess of the three is also a challenge.For all the deficiencies in the resources, this remains the single largest challenge to conquer.Overwhelming competitionIt has never been more challenging to create space for yourself in the crowded arena of social media.New content, ads, communication & products launched daily, it is difficult to make a niche and maintain it.With the presence of competitors, both big and small, this can be very overwhelming.Maintaining consistencyPre-planning, rediscovering new USPs, retelling stories, matching the thought or idea with the right image and words, finding the right hashtag, the to & fro dance of approvals between the agency and the client - YEESH!“I easily maintain my schedule of producing and sharing quality content,” said no marketing manager ever.The presence of paid promotionsIt is a common tale where the giants spend more and capture the limited attention span of the target audiences. Organic can help but it is limited thanks to algorithm changes and what not.The share of my pie is stolen by the paid promotions of my competitors.Unrealistic expectationsIt is not uncommon to underestimate, or as most often is the case, overestimate oneself. Seeing or even understanding that there is a boundary line is difficult.Expecting overnight results is a rarity in this field. So is patience.Running out of ideasCreative block, writer’s block, blogger’s block…..Just blocked. Inspiration is not easy to come by.And it's expected, that we punctually churn out new, different, out-of-the-box, disruptive ideas.Measuring upAnd I am yet to come across the perfect reporting system that will measure my efforts and throw up the results in a simple understandable and comprehensible way. It would be nice if I could get relevant, non-generic insights too.My brain had turned to soup!I realized that it was not the lack of experience, expertise or information that was the problem. They were, in fact, the raw materials. It was the lack of structure of these raw materials that was lacking. Once I defined the role of each aspect and gave them a shape, all problems and challenges didn’t seem daunting at all.This was my ‘Neo’ moment from The Matrix.Time to set the goal and make the plan.If you enjoyed reading this, do check out my blog The Preeti Effect.","Updated Jun 2, 2018","{'sadness': 0.535302, 'joy': 0.628412, 'fear': 0.177974, 'disgust': 0.10998, 'anger': 0.129931}",Satisfied,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-top-3-social-media-marketing-challenges,What are your top 3 social media marketing challenges?

Problems of social media,"I moved to the US for college and really miss the ability to quickly get DIY fixes/parts or cheap repair for all kinds of stuff.I had a microwave with the revolving ring broken and I had to put it in outside my home and buy a new one as the ring was not easily available here and either costed as much as $20–30 (microwave itself was like $60) or had to be shipped from china by untrusted ebay sellers. I also had to throw away a mixer/grinder set because the blade was broken and it costed as much as the entire mixer.If it was a developing country, I could have easily got these things repaired or have a good recycling/old parts market to sell it for a decent price. I never used to throw away these kind of things when I was in India.I had this lamp but the wire was stretched and broken by mistake when I was moving out of my apartment. Instead of throwing away, I decided to put it in my luggage bag and took it 8,000 miles to my home, got it repaired in about $2 and it still works fine back home. :DDue to the purchasing power that we have, all these little items seem trivial and repairs are more of a trouble than just buying new and throwing away old stuff. It is what makes us the largest consumer market and ends up wasting valuable resources.

Problems of social media,"Thanks for the A2A. Here are my admittedly first world problems:1. Holiday shopping. I hate holiday shopping. Shopping during the holidays is absolutely miserable. Now, don't get me wrong; I love buying gifts for the people I love. Just not for all 15 of them, all at the same time. Moreover, every store is a madhouse filled with people frantically pulling things off the shelves like there's no tomorrow. Even online shopping gets stressful as items' status change from in-stock to sold out right before one's eyes. I'm not a fan of buying poor quality items frequently and would rather possess fewer, more expensive, high quality items. So, the never-ending cycle in the U.S. of holiday after holiday, encouraging consumers to stock up on poorly made items they'll rarely use, irritates the heck out of me. 2. Subway: People without subway etiquette. Pole huggers who use the entire pole so that no one else can grab on, in the middle of rush hour in New York. Also, public service announcement, ladies: YOUR HANDBAG DOES NOT NEED ITS OWN FRIGGIN' SEAT, especially on a crowded train. Put your bag on your lap. Increasingly I've also started to spot asinine male passengers who also use up an entire seat with their shopping bag or man-bag. PUT IT ON THE FLOOR OR ON YOUR DAMN LAP. Another subway pet peeve? People who don't give up their seat for pregnant women or injured people. In the last six months, I have been the ONLY person in crowded trains to give up my seat for pregnant women and people using crutches. Man up, people. Have some decency. 3.

Problems of social media,"I've got a few. I'm not especially proud of these, but here we go.Shoes.I organize something in my room everyday. This includes putting up my shoes in these magical things.Yeah. I've got two of them. They hang inside my closet doors. I'm not sure if I should be ashamed of this but, I've got too many shoes and they won't all fit. Which means that I have to put them in the back of my closet. You see, I would get rid of some shoes, but I actually use them all. My older brother has five pairs of shoes. I've got 32. Eight pairs have to sit on the ground. I should probably be ashamed of this. (I put the shoes to good use. I take care of them. Once I outgrow them, I give them to Salvation Army of Goodwill.)Walking.Last night I was having a problem. And I'm having to right now as well. I just came back from a 8 hour rehersal and wanted to be a normal person and play video games. The problem was that I hadn't eaten since 4, and it was 11 at night. I was hungry. I really could have gone for some cereal. The only problem was that I was in the living room. Not the kitchen.I. Have. To. Walk? Heaven forbid!No. I'm not doing this today.So now it's 5:36 AM and I haven't eaten in more than 13 hours. Right now I'm considering going to the kitchen to feed myself. No. My room is on the other side of the house from the kitchen. So currently, I am sitting on my bed listening to Aladdin mix tapes at 5:40AM, and am quite hungry.Another issue is the fact that technology has to charge. My bed is a solid 10 from my wall. Unfortuneatly, to charge said technology, I have to plug them in. Which yet again, requires walking. Once they die, I usually think about life or other things.Another issue that drastically effects my life is the location of my earbuds. Usually, they're located by my chair and I yet again, don't want to walk. When they get tangled, that's the worst.Getting water in the middle of the night is also a daily challenge. I have to walk to the closet fridge, which is down an entire hallway. Then, of course, there are those times in which you are tired and you realize you didn't turn off the lights. It's a terrible feeling when the realization of walking when you're tired dawns on you.To make my laziness easier to visualize, I drew this lovely layout of my room. The red X is the location of where my earbuds usually are. The blue X are where my outlets do plug in my devices are. The ""my domain"" part of my bed is where I always sit.Short onesSlow wifi. Sometimes it goes out, and I have to turn it off and back on.Traffic. Enough said.Lines. (At Starbucks.)When your nose is too small to fit both your glasses and sunglasses so you have to endure the blinding sun.When that dreaded username is already taken or incorrect password appears on your screen.But I'd say the worst one is when you can't skip an ad. I hate it when I have to spend 20 seconds of my life watching an ad about a new bar or something when I'd rather get to my video faster. There should always be a skip ad button.I could probably go on for hours over this, but since it's 6:10 AM, and I have endured 14 brutal hours without food, I am going to go bother walking and eat cereal.

Problems of social media,"Each social platform has it's strengths and weaknesses, but it's varies a lot. This answer is completely subjective though, so please take my answer as such. The largest issue that all platforms have in common is money. Money has taken an incredible idea of connecting people to a level that people resist being attached to them. Of course, each platform deals with that issue differently. Let me dive in.FacebookFacebook is the monster so I will start here. I want to break this into a few sections. Facebook's big properties right now are Pages, Groups, Profiles. I won't touch Messenger because people either use it or they don't. So let's go!Facebook PagesPages are a thing of the past. People who are starting pages should stop. They are of no value unless you plan on paying to get reach. The typical page post reach is somewhere between .01%-12%. It primarily depends on if it's just text, just an image, or a mix of image & a link to a website, and you can put your own mix together. The result is basically, not much. For some pages they have greater success because they are consistent and they are putting out amazing content. For the majority of us, that's not the case. Pages aren't getting the attention of businesses or the media as they once did. I can remember seeing the facebook icon everywhere with the tag ""Follow Us on Facebook"" and now hardly anyone does it. The product has gone to the wayside.Facebook GroupsGroups is where facebook shines. This is probably now the heart and soul of the platform. It's more engaging and meaningful. You don't get the lame posts that people post to the own feeds. They are niche targeted and usually informative. It is much easier to get the conversation started in groups and actually connect with like-minded strangers.I also think groups is where businesses and influencers can score big wins by starting a related group and build it to leverage conversation and attain real leads. Now this paragraph is basically about marketing and not personal. I think people get a lot out of groups, but I think marketers, businesses, high-profile people can benefit greatly from building a large and active group.Facebook ProfilesOnce upon a time games like Mafia Wars drove huge droves of friending. Fast-forward what seems to be a lifetime ago and now the personal profile is highly regarded. Sending a friend request is now reseved for those you truly want to connect with.I don't send game requests anymore. I remove people I don't have a connection with, and I continue to review who is connected to me. I feel as though many friends have resorted to very low quality posts and that has pushed many people to check on facebook less for updates. It doesn't feel awesome anymore as the platform has matured.I don't see facebook going away anytime soon, but I see them maturing into more of a way to stay connected to friends and family. I rarely add a status because I don't feel the need. I refuse to share anything for the most part because often there isn't anything great to share. Facebook's feeds are in terrible shape as far as I am concerned. I am aware of the unfollow feature and grouping contacts into segments. They are nice features but I don't feel like programming my facebook experience.Overall Facebook ExperienceFrom my point of view, facebook is less of a tool in my marketing belt. Personally, I am at the point that my feed sucks so I don't really check it. I think the conversations are cumbersome and don't reflect my interests much.TwitterTwitter is a tougher platform to understand and put skin in the game. You follow people within your interests and sometimes they follow back. Twitter has a lot of witty goodness, but it also has the most SPAM I have ever seen as well. Many posts I see is either follow for follow, read this, rewteet this, and other ""asks"" that turn me off and causes me to unfollow those accounts.I constantly see links upon links to go see this or that. I don't want to leave my Twitter experience to see your splash page on eBooks. Yet, with my complaints about SPAM, I have met some of the most awesome people and built relationships from the service. I have only been using Twitter seriously for about a month now. I disregarded it in the past, but decided to give it a fair shake. I personally am starting to like it.Direct messages are useless as well, and I hate Twit validator. Twitter has some serious cleaning up to do, but that's not their focus. They need to produce money.From a marketing point of view, my 4 marketing accounts are driving more traffic daily to my websites than any other platform. I am converting at a decent rate also. As my following grows so does my Google Analytics reported sessions/users.Twitter has a lot to offer, but it is a pyramid game. It's to follow influencers and celebrities. It's not for nobodies. If you are on twitter and don't have much to offer then just follow people who you have an interest in. Twitter is all about interests and short conversations.PinterestPinterest is still evolving but it has huge potential for gains. The visual social world is where it's at. I am still struggling to find my zen on this platform, but for my small amount of work I did on a couple profiles last year are continuing to pay off. People are just visual creatures and I think this is what raises Pinterest's value.I love going through posts, hearting them, and leaving a comment. I think this is a fun network that is not just for women anymore. I built an iron pipe computer desk this week after getting some ideas from Pinterest and YouTube. This is the place where people can win more by investing.YouTubeIf you aren't here, even with the awful state of comments, then you are losing big time. This includes myself. Because I am not currently putting video out, I am losing considerably and I am well aware of it. The only things I can truly add to YouTube is that Google made a significant error by adding G+ into YouTube.It hasn't added value, and the comments haven't gotten better. Great channels like CPG Grey don't even read the comments and instead opts for Reddit to engage with his fanbase. YouTube is the king of video with it being the #2 search engine in the world. Honestly, it's just an awesome platform with useless commentary 90% of the time.I personally watch about 2-3 hours a day. I watch it from the desktop, Chromecast, mobile, and of course while walking by other computers at work. My apartment has 2 Chromecasts and 21 other network connected devices. YouTube is the #1 platform used in my residence.Marketing wise, YouTube is almost everything at this point. My wife wanted to show off some bags for our upcoming trip to the Philippines on eBags. We surfed some, but mostly we watched the videos about the bags. We are dependent on video. If you are using this then you are not marketing correctly. By that thought process, I am currently not marketing correctly either.SoundcloudSoundcloud is the untapped resource, even though it's been out for a while. Some people like myself can't grasp how to use the platform. There isn't an easy way to grow your following unless you are consistently posting in groups or marketing your sounds off the platform.I don't really see the point of their groups. It's just people adding all their stuff and it has never felt social to me. The commenting systems on the entire platform doesn't encourage conversation. To me, Soundcloud is just a cloud storage system that happens to have some social features.. I podcast and upload here, but podcasting is tough on Soundcloud. They give you an RSS feed and I can create playlists, but beyond those stellar features, it is a very uphill battle to become popular. I have to build my presence elsewhere for it to matter on Soundcloud. Overall Score Across PlatformsPersonal#1 Youtube: We all love video. I consume tons with my Chromecast.#2 Pinterest: Visual and I love the interaction.#3 Soundcloud: I podcast like crazy and it's cheap to go pro.#4 Twitter: I have met incredible people there.#5 Google Plus (even if I didn't address it) I still think it's awesome.#6 FacebookMarketing, Branding, Business#1 Youtube: #2 Search Engine in the world.#2 Soundcloud: Audio is second to video.#3 Pinterest: Visual wins here and traffic converts.#4 Twitter: You can build your following fast and see results.#5 Google Plus (even if I didn't address it) Still good for SEO and traffic.#6 Facebook: Sucks unless you focus on dark posts for adverts.I was tempted to just post this on my website because it's so detailed, but it should live here instead. There are more platforms, but I think this at least discusses some of the main ones that I currently dabble in. If you want me to go deeper in one of the points just let me know. I would be happy to do so.Thanks for the great question!Adam","Answered Apr 6, 2015","{'sadness': 0.506304, 'joy': 0.601081, 'fear': 0.096888, 'disgust': 0.073118, 'anger': 0.129942}",Satisfied,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-biggest-problems-with-current-social-media-sites-Facebook-Twitter-etc,"What are the biggest problems with current social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)?"

Problems of social media,"It's mainly a problem with how people use it not a product problem:- FB: Too many philosophical quotations on random backgrounds and too many funny videos. As the number of friends reaches several hundreds, the newsfeed becomes way too messy from my point of view. Barely 5% of what I see on my FB newsfeed is interesting and there is no scalable way for me to filter what type of content I want to see as I can only filter from whom I want to see news.- Instagram becomes increasingly popular mainly because its newsfeed isn't as polluted with posts other than pictures but Instagram influences people badly in my opinion. Sexy, materialistic, rather hollow personnality type of young girls tend to think that they're superstars because hundreds of people like and comments on their pictures, so they tend to consider themselves likes celebrities but online only. This ego inflating behaviour leads them to believe they're superior to most of us. The same type of behaviour occurs with ""rich cool kids"" type of Instagram accounts and it contributes to making the society more and more materialistic- TWITTER: To me it's a similar problem as FB because people who are active enough to follow you from scratch are also too active, meaning they tweet too often and ""pollutes"" the newsfeed.To me, there is a REAL PROBLEM WITH THE FOLLOWING SYSTEM in place in the majority of social networks. If I follow someone for startup or aviation news, I don't neccessarly want to see this person's posts if they're about fashion or basketball but I can only FULLY follow him or not at all.Sure, you have Reddit or Pinterest boards but it doesn't solve the problem as well as I imagined our product will (Intoo ; Page on intoo.im if you're interested)","Answered Apr 8, 2015","{'sadness': 0.309806, 'joy': 0.269644, 'fear': 0.143157, 'disgust': 0.487093, 'anger': 0.147245}",Very Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-biggest-problems-with-current-social-media-sites-Facebook-Twitter-etc,"What are the biggest problems with current social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)?"

Problems of social media,"I think the answer is quite relative and depends on your goals as to what to do you want to achieve and what is your target audience.

Even for your personal use, before deciding your network site you should ask yourself what type of audience and content do you want to interact with. For me, Instagram and 9 gag are better networking sites than Facebook.  For many Twitter would be the correct platform to engage.

Problems of social media,"Well, Firstly, better in what terms?If you are looking for scale & reach then Facebook is Number1. 2 Billion users are on Facebook with 600 Million users on Instagram which Facebook has bought, so no other social media is going to get any bigger sooner & even if any other platform is going to get bigger I am assuming Facebook will buy it off.Now that we have established that for scale & reach Facebook is going to be the market leader.Let us look at other social media platforms & what they are known for.Pinterest - >150 Million users are on Pinterest & around 93% of the users are either actively planning or buying products on Pinterest. Pinterest has just started gathering traction in India & the feature of “Promoted Pins” which will allow you to run ads of your pins to other users is yet to be launched in India. Pinterest is best for B2C companies looking to sell products.LinkedIn - >450 Million users are active on LinkedIn & it is the best known professional network in the world. It is great for B2B networking & for professional growth. So if you are a business which caters to other businesses then your presence on LinkedIn is a must.Twitter - 330 Million users are on Twitter. Twitter can be used to create trending topics to create buzz but the name of the game in Twitter is to post multiple times a day the same post & to retweet previous posts. Can help with B2B businesses.Snapchat - Newest Kid on the block & has 150 Million active users who login into the platform daily. If your products cater to audience from 13 - 18 years then Snapchat is the platform for you. Snapchat faces lots of importance on videos so to be active you should be ready to create lots of video content.You can get more information on these specific platforms, their ideal audience & some examples from our blog: A Beginners Guide to Social Media Marketing 2018Hope that helpsThanksSirishaFounder, Head-Marketingwww.brandingbypixels.com","Answered May 23, 2018","{'sadness': 0.159689, 'joy': 0.657155, 'fear': 0.055431, 'disgust': 0.048842, 'anger': 0.049072}",Very Satisfied,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-better-social-network-site-than-Facebook,Is there any better social network site than Facebook?

Problems of social media,"Spending too much time on social media is almost a given in this day and age. But hours of scrolling through Twitter, Instagram, and the like could result in a health issue, according to some experts. A new study believes that behaviours exhibited by those who overuse social media is comparable to the same behaviours shown by drug addicts. But is social media addiction a disorder in the eyes of psychiatry?Perhaps you're a social media addict yourself. When you think about it, you're not quite sure how you got to this place. You only know that you need to change, somehow. Or, it's possible that others are telling you that you're addicted to social media, but you're in denial. Either way, if you suspect there might be a problem, it's important to learn as much about it as possible.A social media addict is someone who feels compelled to use social media frequently throughout the day. This person doesn't just check Facebook or Instagram once in a while. There are feelings associated with social media. Strong feelings that won't go away, and just keep getting stronger.According to an article on the CBS News website, one social media marketer has just quit Facebook. He was fearful that he had developed an addiction. He likened Facebook to a digital water cooler. He was quoted as stating, “It was a constant interruption pulling me away from the work that I was otherwise enjoying.”Social media addiction is still a fairly new idea in the world of psychology. However, researchers know that it is a real affliction. It is characterized by two behaviors. People feel an ever-increasing need to engage with it, and they feel bad when they don't get enough. When social media use begins to interfere with other activities, it is considered an addiction.A growing number of people in the United States have social media addictions. Many of them also have other types of addictions. For example, they may also be alcoholics, or suffering from drug addictions. For these individuals, new approaches to addiction treatment are needed.check https://billlentis.com/social-me...","Answered Sep 23, 2019","{'sadness': 0.57419, 'joy': 0.21099, 'fear': 0.48468, 'disgust': 0.112675, 'anger': 0.11635}",Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/How-serious-a-problem-is-social-media-addiction,How serious a problem is social media addiction?

Also for anyone that has a Facebook Group with daily themes that repeat every week (such as ""Make it happen Monday""), OneUp makes it easy to entirely automate this.RSS feed automation - If there are any blogs, publications, podcasts, or YouTube channels that put out good content consistently, you can add the RSS feed links in OneUp, then whenever new content is posted from those places, it is automatically shared to the pages you select.Chrome Extension - Using the OneUp Chrome extension, you can easily schedule many images at once from any website, such as sunsets for example. You can choose which images from the website you want to post to social media, bulk update or individually update the descriptions and links for each post, then schedule them to be posted with a set interval (such as every 60 minutes), or choose custom dates and times for all of them.Customizable UTM parameters - OneUp lets you customize UTM parameters so you can keep track of how your links are performing in Google Analytics.Link Shortening - Connect your Bitly account and OneUp will automatically shorten any links and allow you to track clicks through Bitly.","Answered Aug 8, 2019","{'sadness': 0.021125, 'joy': 0.740423, 'fear': 0.000342, 'disgust': 0.020017, 'anger': 0.181678}",Very Satisfied,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-common-social-media-content-marketing-mistakes,What are the common social media content marketing mistakes?

Problems of social media,"The common social media content marketing mistakes are:-Promoting yourself a lotSocial media is all about being sociable and communicating. People hate promotional content, and they detest adverts. If you spend too much time being promotional, then you are going to lose followers and likes on social media. Promotion needs to be used subtly on social media.Of course, your business needs to sell. Every now and then it’s totally OK to post promotional material. However, the more engagement and social interaction you can include in those posts the more sales you get.No Real FollowersVery little interaction can be a result of no real followers. Some people buy followers just to look better. Some hold contests with prizes like iPads and iPhones where participants are not fans of your page but the products you are giving away. Keeping an active page with a lot of info but no real followers. This means you don’t really have support and weakens your social presence. To avoid this, it’s important to build a slow and steady network of real people.Not Tracking AnalyticsThere’s hardly any point in using social media without actionable insights. Just as you measure the success of your SEO and email marketing campaigns with analytics software, so too should you track and assess your performance metrics on social media. You can use the metrics provided by the platform or utilize an external software to gain extra functionality.Using foul language…even if your competitors do itSome people think it helps them to connect with their viewers. Some just don’t know any better. Their clients may use foul language, as may their suppliers and competitors. Feel free to use foul language in real life if you wish, but keep it off of your social media profile.You may well be connecting with your customer base, but you will have a hard time convincing them to trust you. Foul language often comes from an aggressive stance. Even when used in jest, foul language is aggressive by nature.

Problems of social media,"Make marketing mistakes? We have all made mistakes with our marketing messages. The key is to realize you have made them so as to learn and not repeat them. As you engage customers, avoid these six potential mistakes and take these corrective steps instead:  Use a single communication channelToday there are many channels that your customers use to learn about potential businesses. Therefore, it is best not to rely on a single channel. Recommendation: Don’t leave your old channel; just add new ones over time. Try new message styles to match up with the new channels. In all messages, rely on what you know about your customers to engage. Remember to integrate the messages and channels.   Ignore your competitorsIgnore finding REAL differences with competitors. This usually means you don’t understand your customer needs or what your competitors are doing. Recommendation: Make your value proposition priority one in your marketing. Hands down. To define your value propositions, listen to your customers first and watch your competitors second.   Being repetitiousUsing the same marketing messages over and over. Boring.  Recommendation:  Invent new ways to deliver messages on your products and services. Be daring, bold and creative with messages to customers. Invent new ways to deliver messages on your products and services.   Being irrelevant and non-usefulProvide marketing messages that are not relevant or useful to your customers. Remember people don’t read marketing copy. They read what interests them and provides value.  Recommendation: Your customers’ time is priceless … make your messages something that will interest them. Don’t waste their time with irrelevant, weak messages.  Being non-social Your focus is on everything but being friendly and social. You frequently act as if you don’t care. Recommendation: Spend more time with building customer relationships than marketing. Customer relationships are critical as they build trust in you and your business. Trust is the main reason your customers select your business over your competitors.  Ignoring a call to actionWhen you ignore what action you will take for the customer, you give the customer no reason to remember you. Recommendation: The call to action is the most important factor. It is what you leave behind value when the engagement is ending. Every engagement should end with an action … focus on something positive you will do for the customer.

Such irregularity creates inconvenience to people following your account and waiting for your updates.Solution:1. Identify the best schedule to engage with your social media fans.2. Let them know you have this 'set publishing schedule' you are following to build anticipation.3. Practice being consistent with your new posting schedule.Irregular Branding - Posting statements or comments that are not cohesive in perspective (like opinions on certain policies, beliefs and social views). This can also pertain to any act that contradicts previous positions. Constant changes on logos, slogans and tone of voice also trigger irregularities in branding.Solution: 1. Establish a complete profile about your company (mission, vision, who or what you stand for, etc.)2. Identify the campaign slogan, theme colors and tone of voice that you will use to connect with your followers.3. Make sure to review any social content for inconsistencies before publishing.General Audience Targeting -placing contents that are too generic for the market you are after.

Lack of engagementMost of your ads can be broadcasted on TV, radio etc whereas in magazines you publish your ad. There are other mediums where you find only a one-way communication. This is not fruitful in social media. In social media, people want it to be social. There are lots of ways to be social:Reply to comments on your posts.Ask for comments on your posts.Ask questions.Reply to other people’s posts (and like and share them).2. Reply poorly to negative feedbackLet us see three ways to reply to negative comment:Tit for tat: There are lots of people who fight with each other on social media. That is not good for your business. You need to deal politely with the customers.Ignoring: It is not a smart way to ignore a genuine complaint. If they are angry because of your poor service then you need to wait until their anger subsides and then reply properly.Customer Service: Customer is the first priority of any business. You need to work for their betterment.3. Don’t do too muchThe social media management platform gets the requests from all the automated posting from RSS. It is necessary to check the content first or else it will not be good for audiences. Do not post the same content to all the accounts without reviewing it.4. A frequent mistake is to post stock photography “as is”In order to get few colors onto a page, stock photography on its own is a rush way. Like an image of someone using a laptop. Two people shaking their hands, etc but then there is no interest or context over here. Such images are not good in any scenario.

Not planning aheadThere are lots of WhatsApp groups and facebook pages that were started with a big bang. But after some time, the content are not updated. Questions are not answered. Comments are ignored. The social media campaign fizzles out. This is where the planning part works. When you decide to mark your presence on a social media platform, make sure that you have the time and resources to maintain it regularly.2. Little or no interactionThis happens most times. The social media platform keeps having updates. But there is no option for the followers or subscribers to make their view heard. The communication is only one way. Avoid this.3. Not enough followersWhen it comes to social media organic content marketing, the success depends on having enough followers or subscribers. So you have to actively do something to invite followers to your page or site or blog. The more viewers or followers you have, the better your business is going to be.4. Poor contentSometimes, you do a fine job of marketing your social media platform and your digital footprint is also good. But is the content good enough to retain the followers/ viewers/ subscribers? This is a question that needs to be addressed. Make sure that your content is error-free, looks catchy and readable even by the common man. The content has to be interesting enough to want to read and share too. You can’t afford to compromise on the quality of your content. There are many sites like www.Upwork.com , www.contentmart.com available where you can hire expert freelance content writers to suit your needs. Don’t ever compromise on the quality of your content.All the best for a successful venture of social media marketing!","Answered Mar 4, 2017","{'sadness': 0.542076, 'joy': 0.640433, 'fear': 0.077558, 'disgust': 0.075791, 'anger': 0.075468}",Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-common-social-media-content-marketing-mistakes,What are the common social media content marketing mistakes?
Problems of social media,"If anything, content marketing has made any business owner’s life a lot less complicated. Getting your material out, whichever form it may come as, can be done with one touch of a button.But at the same time, it makes everyone vulnerable to committing mistakes. Some may be shrugged off completely, while others can be very costly.One mistake that is common among content marketers is that their strategy ends after inbound work. For obvious reasons, marketing needs to go beyond it in order to touch on the entire spectrum and become more effective to your users.Another mistake is the tendency to oversee and neglect audiences. It is important to recognize users who interact with the product, whether it is signing up for a free trial or subscribing to your blog. These users would comprise the engagements to your product, which ultimately is the one of the key measurements to success.A costly mistake which many also tend to commit is putting too much focus on product features instead of how it can benefit a user. Never lose sight of why you built this product in the first place: and that is to cater to the needs of a specific market you are targeting.https://www.inturact.com/blog/7-...","Answered Jul 19, 2017","{'sadness': 0.312557, 'joy': 0.594387, 'fear': 0.086596, 'disgust': 0.043267, 'anger': 0.164062}",Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-common-social-media-content-marketing-mistakes,What are the common social media content marketing mistakes?
Problems of social media,"Four Common Mistakes Every Content Marketer MakesContent Marketing, one of the best and most effective ways of lead generation is not as easy as it seems to be.Most of the people think that it’s all about writing big articles using good and sophisticated language a few times in a month, you thought about it the same way right??I wonder if only Content Marketing was that easy!! But, no it is not that simple.The latest studies and researches might show that anybody can succeed at Content Marketing but the real-life truth is exactly the opposite of those studies. Content Writing is not everyone’s cup of tea.You don’t believe me?? Then, check it yourself, just Google any one topic of your interest and you will get millions of blogs written on that specific topic.This means that you already have a lot of competition in your way as Content Marketing is an overcrowded market.So, it is getting more and more tough to rank on a specific keyword as the people we are competing with are already experts of that niche.And after facing all these challenges if we also make mistakes then it would affect our Content negatively.I too made many mistakes and I guess everybody makes one but now I know how to fix them and thus I am here, sharing the mistakes I made and the solutions I found to fix them:Not focusing on your audience’s demandsNot creating Evergreen ContentsCreating Undiversified ContentFocusing on Quantity over QualityNot focusing on your audience’s demandsThis is a very common mistake made by almost all the Content Writers, we make content on the topic that we think might be good to make, irrespective of what our target audience wishes to read.Your audience is the only one who can bring your website to the top of the search engines but only if you are capable and talented enough to please them with your content and they will only be satisfied with the content if they like the topic.As “if you don’t the title of the book you do not read the book”, in the same way if your topic is not attractive enough to attract the users then they might also not look at your content.Making topics which are eye-catching is a must if you wish your content to stay in demand.So how will you know what your audience likes and what they hate?? Well, this is an easy task you can research about your audience’s interests.You can use Facebook ads manager to analyse your target audience or buyer persona so to say. You can select a handful of audience, or the audience following your business page, or simply all the audience following you and the facebook ads manager will let you know the topics your audience is exactly interested in.The main goal over here is to start delivering content which is like by your users, to increase traffic on your website and make your brand famous.Identify trends, and instead of posting content and thinking that your users will like them start analyzing your audience and give them what they what this is the only way you can gain followers and traffic.Not Creating Evergreen ContentsEvergreen content is a content that never loses it’s relevance no matter however old it gets. One of the biggest mistakes that we as Content Writers make is that we make is that we create contents which are trending but do not check if the topic is going to be relevant after some years also or not.Writing content on short lived topics can bring you a huge traffic but just like the topic the traffic will also be short lived and after a short period of time when people will forget about the topic and the topic will lose it’s relevance your traffic will leave you and you will come to your initial level again. Whereas, evergreen content will stay in demand forever and so if you create your content based on any evergreen content then you will never lose your traffic, you keep gaining more and more users instead.If we take an example: Short lived topics are the topics related to changes in politics, real life tragedies of superstars, or anything related to the glamour industry these topics remain trending for a small period of time only till media discusses about such topics and these topics keep changing almost everyday.Whereas, evergreen contents are the ones related to education, tutorials, and all the other useful contents that could be used practically in real life, like any educational blog, marketing blogs, how to do tutorials, etc., these are the topics that will always be searched and will remain in demand as these are certain topics that might never go out of fashion or trend.Writing Undiversified ContentLimiting your write-ups to just one niche will not only limit your knowledge but will also expose you to only one class of users who are from your specified industry.Whereas if you write content on different topics of different industries it will help you increase your knowledge and will also help you reach to a huge number of users of different industries.But writing content of different forms will alone not help you attract traffic to your website.Content also needs images, videos, and infographics to attract people as nobody likes to read anything continuously without any distractions.Imagine you have to read a book which has only text and no images just like a history book!! Sounds terrible right?? When it sounds so terrible to you then how can you expect that your users will enjoy write-ups without any images??So, you must add certain images in your blog in order to make your blog look better and what can be better than adding a video to your blog.A video which summarizes your blog altogether can bring more traffic to your website as video marketing is back again in content marketing trends.Then you can also create an infographics including all the information mentioned in your blog and can add it in your blog to make it a bit more interesting.So, now you know the ways by which you can make your content more attractive and different from the others.Focusing on Quantity over QualityThis is one of the very common mistakes every Content Writer makes. Content Writing is not about the number of articles a content writer creates it’s about the type of content a content writer creates, as your readers judge you according to the quality of your content. Every user wishes to read a good-quality and knowledgeable content and they recommend you only if you provide them with such kind of contents. So, if you wish your users to read your content make sure you provide them with good-quality content to satisfy their thirst of knowledge otherwise they would not follow your write ups and neither will they recommend you to anyone else which will affect your company very badly.ConclusionTo gain lots of traffic and inbound marketing, content marketing is the key.Around 50% of the companies as well as freelancers are using blogging as their main weapon to gain traffic and lots of profit.Content Marketing is totally in demand and since the demand is increasing day by day so your competition is becoming tougher day by day.No blogger is leaving any stone unturned to gain traffic and make their websites rank and you have to do the same, you have compete with people of your same level or maybe even better than you.So I would suggest you to search for a topic of your audience’s interest, then searching for all the evergreen topics instead of viral topics but only according to your audience’s interests, then you might create a content with a variety of attractive element added in your content and never forget to focus on the good-quality of your content.Making good content and making your website rank higher with the help of that content is not very hard but it is also not that easy.If you follow these points mentioned above I hope it might help you achieve your goals, just avoid these mistakes and you will rock already.A very Good Luck!!If you wish to know more about Content Marketing and it’s Strategies read my in-depth content about Content Marketing on Promotedigitally.","Answered May 25, 2019","{'sadness': 0.445064, 'joy': 0.700571, 'fear': 0.071725, 'disgust': 0.060536, 'anger': 0.430999}",Satisfied,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-common-social-media-content-marketing-mistakes,What are the common social media content marketing mistakes?
Problems of social media,"1. Is Your Post Telling A Story?If your social media post isn’t telling a story, or telling a boring or repetitive one, why would it ever turn your page viewers into your followers? Make your picture tell a story with your caption. That’s what its there for.2. Are You Posting At The Right Time?Because that is REALLY important! The internet is full of studies claiming to know the best posting times for social networks. Often the data can be somewhat conflicting.3. Not Checking The Analytics Yet?Are you using any tools for instagram to understand and get updated with all the analytics for your account. I didn’t before. And now that I do, to my surprise, it’s so helpful. Start using before you waste a lot of time not utilising the feature. I use BUFFER. Steal it if you want!4. Not Using Hashtags Or Spamming Instead?Posts with at least one hashtag average 12.6 percent more engagement than those without on Instagram, according to a study by Simply Measured. That explains whyseven out of 10 hashtags are branded.Make sure to use those babies and get more page views and followers. But at the same time, make sure not to use too many that you spam.5. Are You Engaging To Your Viewers & Followers?According to a 2016 Forrester report, Instagram has a 2.2 percent per-follower interaction rate. That dwarfs the other networks, including Facebook with its 0.22 percent rate.6. Not Using High Quality Images?This one is SUPER IMPORTANT. Let’s be honest, we, humans, love watching pretty stuff, it’s such an off to see low resolution photos. It’s always worth it to take extra time to make that picture pretty.7. Not Posting For Long Or Posting Too Much?Inconsistency is the WORST. The followers you got last week for that amazing post you shared, are now all disinterested and gone. Just remember, the genuine followers would stick only when they get what your posts have been promising them.8. Not Having A Strategy Yet?Posting unplanned? It might feel like no big deal as of now but trust me, it’s so much better once you have an organised plan of posting. I, yet again, use Buffer for the same.9. Promoting Too Much Or Desperately Asking For Followers?Promotions kill the fun, and without the fun, your followers are not going to stick around or you might now even gain any followers for this reason. I didn’t promote at all, though but I find too many pages which promote too much or ask despreately for being followed, such an off again.","Answered May 13, 2018","{'sadness': 0.200915, 'joy': 0.598474, 'fear': 0.086676, 'disgust': 0.113374, 'anger': 0.137947}",Dissatisfied,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-common-social-media-content-marketing-mistakes,What are the common social media content marketing mistakes?

Not understanding your audienceBefore starting content marketing, you need to figure out who your audience is and what type of information they’ll be most likely to respond to. You can’t just write about something you want people to read. Any piece of content you create should have a target audience, that is, a group of people that share a few commonalities.This target audience is best structured by using a marketing technique called “customer personas”, which involves creating fictional, generalized representations of your potential customers. With this personas, you can make clear what problems and needs your audience have, so that much easier and effective content creation can be done.Mistake 2. Not differentiating content marketing from advertisingSome marketers regard content marketing as a tool for selling, but they are not the same. Just like any other type of marketing, the goal of content marketing is to attract, persuade, and convert your readers to do what you want them to do, but in a progressive way.Think of your content as a chance to create interesting and continuous conversations with potential or existing customers.Mistake 3.

You should always check your content before publishing online. You can use several free tools, such as the Hemingway Editor and Grammarly, to help you double-check your content.[1]Poor writing and grammar can be enough to make a potential customer turn to another business.Mistake 4. Not caring about keyword strategy and SEOHave you ever done a research before starting content creation on which keywords are associated with your business to the largest extent?
